# Indy Fridge üçª

This is a fun project to scratch a couple of my own itches.
The codebase generates a static site, updated each day, with
snappy search for the craft beer takeout fridge at The Independent
in Brighton, UK. https://indy-fridge.jobyharding.com

If you find yourself in Brighton and enjoy craft beer it should
be first on your list https://theindependent.pub/

This entirely my own project and is not affiliated with The Independent.
Hopefully some other Indy 'locals' will find it useful.

## For the Technically Curious

Search uses Algolia's *vanilla* JavaScript Instant Search API.
I used this project to figure out whether it was feasible to
connect Algolia with Alpine JS for a user experience equivalent to
their React API which can feel unnecessarily complex.

As such, I've used an event-driven approach where `window` object is
used as an event bus to prevent tight coupling between components.

## TODO
- [x] Keyboard focus styles
- [x] Add a favicon
- [ ] Add filters in a modal
- [x] QR code
- [ ] Cache SQLite database between builds so spidering only happens once a day
- [ ] Add responsive can images (save these to storage)
- [ ] Fix hops layout when there are lots of hops
- [ ] Touch icons & alternate favicons
